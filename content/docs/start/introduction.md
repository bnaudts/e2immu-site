## Welcome

Welcome to the _e2immu_ documentation.

We recommend [The Road to Immutability →](/docs/road-to-immutability.html) as a first introduction to the analyser. This document is also available as PDF in the [Immutability →]({{< relref "immutability" >}}) section.

All downloads (sources, jars) can be found on _e2immu_'s [GitHub page →](https://github.com/e2immu).

## Timeline

_e2immu_ is not ready yet. While all concepts are stable, the analyser is not robust enough yet to be applied in production settings.

We try to adhere to the following timing:

* 1st May 2021: open source release
* 1st August 2021: alpha release, one IDE plugin working
* 1st November 2021: beta release, one IDE plugin working, can analyse most of its own code
* 1st January 2022: version 1.0.0
